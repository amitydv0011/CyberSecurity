	Vulnerability Assessment is a process of examination, discovery, and identification of a system and applications security measures and weakness. It helps to recognize the vulnerabilities that could be exploited, need of additional security layers, and information that can be revealed using scanners.  

Reason behind the Existence vulnerability

Hardware or software misconfiguration
Insecure or poor design of the network  and application
old technology weaknesses
careless approach of end users

TCP/IP 
OS
Network device Vulnerabilities :- lake of password protection, lack of authentication, Firewall , wifi
user account vuln :- user account details , same password 
system account vuln :- weak passwords
Internet service misconfiguration :- 
Default password setting 
Network device misconfiguration

# Vulnerability Assessment Life-Cycle
 
---Pre-Assessment--        
 Identify Assets
 Create a Baseline
-- Vulnerability Assessment Phase
    Vulnerability Scan
    Vulnerability Analysis
---- Post Assessment Phase ---
         Risk Assessment
         Remediation
         Verification
         Monitoring
 
	- Discover: Discover Vulnerability
	- Priotize : Priotize Vulnerability as per its target, impact, loss value, Bussiness Impact, etc.
	- Report : Prepare a report on Vulnerability.
	- Remediate : Take appropriate perventive actions.
	- Verify : Verify that vulnerability is resolved or not.
	- Monitor : Monitor the network traffic and system behaviors for any further intrusion.

# Vulnerability Scoring System - CVSS (Critical Vulnerability Scoring System) -> CVE-CWE
	- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v2.0)
		- Low: 0.0 - 3.9
		- Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
		- High: 7.0 - 10.0

	- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3.0)
		- None: 0.0 - INFO   
		- Low: 0.1 - 3.9
		- Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
		- High: 7.0 - 8.9
		- Critical: 9.0 - 10.0

# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) - Whenever a Vulnerability is exposed globally it is distinguished by it CVE number.
	- Platforms to find information about vulnerabilities

# Vulnerability Scanners
	Vulnerability Scanners are automated utilities to detect vulnerabilities. They are capable of :-
		- OS Detection and Version Detection
		- Applications Installed
		- Accounts with Weak Passwords
		- Missing Patches
		- Weak/Misconfigured Network and Risky Ports
	These scanning tools perform deep inspection of scripts, open ports, banners, running services, configuration errors, etc...

# Top scanners:
	- Nmap Scripts - Vuln, discovery, safe, etc
	- Acunetix
	- Nessus
	- Qualys Free Scan
	- Crashtest - https://crashtest.cloud/login

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attack Vector (AV): Path traversal typically occurs over the network (i.e., via HTTP, FTP, or other network protocols), which means the attack vector would likely be Network (N).

Attack Complexity (AC): If the vulnerability can be exploited easily without much skill or additional conditions, the complexity would be considered Low (L).

Privileges Required (PR): In many path traversal scenarios, the attacker doesn’t need to have administrative privileges, so this could be None (N) or Low (L), depending on the specific vulnerability.

User Interaction (UI): Path traversal vulnerabilities often don’t require user interaction, so this could be None (N).

Impact Metrics (Confidentiality (C), Integrity (I), Availability (A)): Path traversal could allow an attacker to read sensitive files, which would impact Confidentiality (C). It might also affect Integrity (I) or Availability (A), depending on what an attacker can do with the files they access.
