___----------------------Information Security Triangle or CIA Trait and Non-Repudiation----------------------------
		- **Confidentiality**
			- Confidentiality :-  Ensures that Information is only accessible by right person i.e. only Authorized person can saee the information. Protection from unauthorized access. Confidentiality is ensured by implementing Authentication Checks (User Name and Password), Captcha (Mitigate Brute-force and prevent from Bots), etc. Confidential info should be stored in private offline storage and keep in a safe place, or encrypt data if possible.
			- Popular attacks affecting confidentiality : Data Breaches, Card Skimming, Keylogging, Phishing, Dumpster Diving, etc.
		- **Integrity**
			- Integrity Ensures that Information can only tempered by Authorized by person or it should not be tempered by unauthorized person. Info. either in rest or transit should not be tempered. Integrity is ensured by Encryption, double-triple Encoding, Hashing, salted hashing, MAC (Message Authentication Code), or we can say with the help of Cryptography.
			- Popular Attacks affecting Integrity : MITM, Packet sniffing, etc
		- **Availability**
		 	- Availability ensures that Info. is only available to the right person at the right time, i.e. whenever the info. is requested it should be available.
 Assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by the authorized users.
			- Popular Attacks Affecting Availability : DOS, DDOS, human error , software failure  etc.
		- **Non-Repudiation**
		 	- Non-Repudiation ensures that Person A or Person B can't deny for action performed or happened on there side. For Example, suppose Person A send Money to Person B, so person B can't say money was never received. Like we have proof (Bank Statement, Account Balance Increment, Balance Deduction on Person A's side).

The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data, or destruction of data.

Disclosure is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
Alteration is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
Destruction/Denial is the opposite of Availability.
The opposite of the CIA Triad would be the DAD Triad: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction.

Consider the previous example of patient records and related systems:

Disclosure: As in most modern countries, healthcare providers must maintain medical records’ confidentiality. As a result, if an attacker succeeds in stealing some of these medical records and dumping them online to be viewed publicly, the health care provider will incur a loss due to this data disclosure attack.
Alteration: Consider the gravity of the situation if the attacker manages to modify patient medical records. This alteration attack might lead to the wrong treatment being administered, and consequently, this alteration attack could be life-threatening.
Destruction/Denial: Consider the case where a medical facility has gone completely paperless. If an attacker manages to make the database systems unavailable, the facility will not be able to function properly. They can go back to paper temporarily; however, the patient records won’t be available. This denial attack would stall the whole facility.


 we will introduce three foundational security models:

Bell-LaPadula Model
The Biba Integrity Model
The Clark-Wilson Model
Bell-LaPadula Model
The Bell-LaPadula Model aims to achieve confidentiality by specifying three rules:

Simple Security Property : This property is referred to as “no read up”; it states that a subject at a lower security level cannot read an object at a higher security level. This rule prevents access to sensitive information above the authorized level.
Star Security Property : This property is referred to as “no write down”; it states that a subject at a higher security level cannot write to an object at a lower security level. This rule prevents the disclosure of sensitive information to a subject of lower security level.
Discretionary-Security Property : This property uses an access matrix to allow read and write operations. An example access matrix is shown in the table below and used in conjunction with the first two properties.
Subjects	Object A	Object B
Subject 1	Write	No access
Subject 2	Read/Write	Read
The first two properties can be summarized as “write up, read down.” You can share confidential information with people of higher security clearance (write up), and you can receive confidential information from people with lower security clearance (read down).

There are certain limitations to the Bell-LaPadula model. For example, it was not designed to handle file-sharing.

Biba Model
The Biba Model aims to achieve integrity by specifying two main rules:

Simple Integrity Property : This property is referred to as “no read down”; a higher integrity subject should not read from a lower integrity object.
Star Integrity Property : This property is referred to as “no write up”; a lower integrity subject should not write to a higher integrity object.
These two properties can be summarized as “read up, write down.” This rule is in contrast with the Bell-LaPadula Model, and this should not be surprising as one is concerned with confidentiality while the other is with integrity.

Biba Model suffers from various limitations. One example is that it does not handle internal threats (insider threat).

Clark-Wilson Model
The Clark-Wilson Model also aims to achieve integrity by using the following concepts:

Constrained Data Item (CDI) : This refers to the data type whose integrity we want to preserve.
Unconstrained Data Item (UDI) : This refers to all data types beyond CDI, such as user and system input.
Transformation Procedures (TPs) : These procedures are programmed operations, such as read and write, and should maintain the integrity of CDIs.
Integrity Verification Procedures (IVPs) : These procedures check and ensure the validity of CDIs.
