___----------------------Information Security Triangle or CIA Trait and Non-Repudiation----------------------------
		- **Confidentiality**
			- Confidentiality :-  Ensures that Information is only accessible by right person i.e. only Authorized person can saee the information. Protection from unauthorized access. Confidentiality is ensured by implementing Authentication Checks (User Name and Password), Captcha (Mitigate Brute-force and prevent from Bots), etc. Confidential info should be stored in private offline storage and keep in a safe place, or encrypt data if possible.
			- Popular attacks affecting confidentiality : Data Breaches, Card Skimming, Keylogging, Phishing, Dumpster Diving, etc.
		- **Integrity**
			- Integrity Ensures that Information can only tempered by Authorized by person or it should not be tempered by unauthorized person. Info. either in rest or transit should not be tempered. Integrity is ensured by Encryption, double-triple Encoding, Hashing, salted hashing, MAC (Message Authentication Code), or we can say with the help of Cryptography.
			- Popular Attacks affecting Integrity : MITM, Packet sniffing, etc
		- **Availability**
		 	- Availability ensures that Info. is only available to the right person at the right time, i.e. whenever the info. is requested it should be available.
 Assurance that the systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by the authorized users.
			- Popular Attacks Affecting Availability : DOS, DDOS, human error , software failure  etc.
		- **Non-Repudiation**
		 	- Non-Repudiation ensures that Person A or Person B can't deny for action performed or happened on there side. For Example, suppose Person A send Money to Person B, so person B can't say money was never received. Like we have proof (Bank Statement, Account Balance Increment, Balance Deduction on Person A's side).

The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via the disclosure of secret data, alteration of data, or destruction of data.

Disclosure is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
Alteration is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
Destruction/Denial is the opposite of Availability.
The opposite of the CIA Triad would be the DAD Triad: Disclosure, Alteration, and Destruction.

Consider the previous example of patient records and related systems:

Disclosure: As in most modern countries, healthcare providers must maintain medical records’ confidentiality. As a result, if an attacker succeeds in stealing some of these medical records and dumping them online to be viewed publicly, the health care provider will incur a loss due to this data disclosure attack.
Alteration: Consider the gravity of the situation if the attacker manages to modify patient medical records. This alteration attack might lead to the wrong treatment being administered, and consequently, this alteration attack could be life-threatening.
Destruction/Denial: Consider the case where a medical facility has gone completely paperless. If an attacker manages to make the database systems unavailable, the facility will not be able to function properly. They can go back to paper temporarily; however, the patient records won’t be available. This denial attack would stall the whole facility.
