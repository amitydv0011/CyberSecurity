1 What is a Firewall and why is it used?
A Firewall is a network security system set on the boundaries of the system/network that monitors and controls network traffic. Firewalls are mainly used to protect the system/network from viruses, worms, malware, etc. Firewalls can also be to prevent remote access and content filtering.


2 What is the difference between IDS and IPS?
IDS is Intrusion Detection System and it only detects intrusions and the administrator has to take care of preventing the intrusion. Whereas, in IPS i.e., Intrusion Prevention System, the system detects the intrusion and also takes actions to prevent the intrusion.

 3 HIDS is set up on a particular host/device. It monitors the traffic of a particular device and suspicious system activities. On the other hand, NIDS is set up on a network. It monitors traffic of all device of the network.

4. What is a three-way handshake?
A three-way handshake is a method used in a TCP/IP network to create a connection between a host and a client. Itâ€™s called a three-way handshake because it is a three-step method in which the client and server exchanges packets. The three steps are as follows:

The client sends a SYN(Synchronize) packet to the server check if the server is up or has open ports
The server sends SYN-ACK packet to the client if it has open ports
The client acknowledges this and sends an ACK(Acknowledgment) packet back to the server.

5.How is Encryption different from Hashing?
Both Encryption and Hashing are used to convert readable data into an unreadable format. The difference is that the encrypted data can be converted back to original data by the process of decryption but the hashed data cannot be converted back to original data.

33. What are salted hashes?
Salt is a random data. When a properly protected password system receives a new password, it creates a hash value of that password, a random salt value, and then the combined value is stored in its database. This helps to defend against dictionary attacks and known hash attacks.

Example: If someone uses the same password on two different systems and they are being used using the same hashing algorithm, the hash value would be same, however, if even one of the system uses salt with the hashes, the value will be different.
