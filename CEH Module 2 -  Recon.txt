# Foot printing & Reconnaissance.
	Collecting info regarding internal and external security architecture. Foot printing and Recon help attacker to reduce focus area and bring closer to the target. Collect information about a target network.
	
#################-Active Foot printing : Collect info with Direct interaction

Active Recon :- Active recon is a technique used in  hacking involves  gathering information about the target with direct interaction. The goal of active reconnaissance is to identify vulnerabilities in the target system that can be exploited in a cyberattack.

###############- Passive Footprinting : Collect info without direct interaction

Passive Attack(recon) :- Passive recon involves information gathering about the target without direct interaction. It is mainaly useful when the information gathering activities are not to be detected by the target .
		Methods:
			- Public Emails - Email Addresses available on Webpages.
  Email Foot Printing:-
   Email Tracking Tool, Get email.io ,email hunter
   GetEmail.io finds the Email Address Of Anyone on Earth

			- WHOIS - WHOIS give us info about Domain like when registered, expiry, owner, etc.

TLDS :- Sublister,subfinder,urlcrazy,dig,DnsRecon,Findsub Domains 
   dig = Domain Information Groper. It is used for retrieving information about DNS name servers


			- IP Geolocation - Geolocation of Server and Organization
			**DNS Footprinting**
				- Server IP - Server IP Address
				- MX - Mail Server used for handling Emails for that domain.
				- TTL - Time to Live (After how many hops packet will be discarded)
				- CNAME - Provides additional names or aliases for the address record
			**Social Engineering**
				- Eavesdropping - process of intercepting unauthorized communication to gather information.
				- Shoulder Surfing - Secretly observing the target to gather sensitive information like passwords, personal identification information, account information etc.
				- Dumpster Diving:  This is a process of collecting sensitive information by. looking into the trash/bin.
